# A Fertile Life
 
## To Compile
1. Start a live server.
2. Run the "Test Project" task and wait a while.
3. Run the task to build and watch the HTML file.

## To Note
- Try to reduce the use of ids in css as much as possible. You can use id attributes, i.e [id="..."] instead (make sure to only use this in the "base" folder).
- Every passage should be given the appropriate tags. If a passage occurs in a particualr location, give it tags prepended by `location_` and/or `subLocation_` as required. Ensure that these locations have corresponding co-ordinates in `locationDataObject` in `location_declarations.ts`
