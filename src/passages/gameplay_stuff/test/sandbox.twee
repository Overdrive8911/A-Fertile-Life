    Here, you are. Standing in the middle of the void. Surrounded by the nothingness that once held your reality together. That time is long past however. You came here for a reason; to experiment, to experiment to your fill. In this place, nothing can truly be created or destroyed but the dark matter her can be moulded to your will.

    It's time to get down to business, so go on and manipulate this new world to how you see fit!
