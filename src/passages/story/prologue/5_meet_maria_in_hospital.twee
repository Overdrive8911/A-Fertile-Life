    You tell Mr. Fert that your questions have been satisfied and he nods in response. 
    <span class="maleSpeech">
        “And just in time too, the lady I requested for should be nearing our location, right about no—”
    </span>
</p>

<p>
    <span class="otherSpeech">
        <i>Knock knock.</i>
    </span> 
    A knock on the door interrupts him from finishing, however he smiles and continues, 
    <span class="maleSpeech">
        “That must be her,”
    </span> he tells you. 
    After which, he turns to the door and vocalises, 
    <span class="maleSpeech">
        “Come in!”
    </span>
</p>

<p>
    /*NOTE - She's wearing a hoodie bcus she doesn't want people to see her being pregnant */
    The door opens to reveal a feminine figure wearing an awkwardly-oversized black hoodie, who hastily walks into the office and grabs a close-by chair to sit on — although, not without clumsily bumping into a few. 
    <span class="femaleSpeech1">
        “Sorry I'm late, there were some <i>complications</i> with the task you gave me…”
    </span> she says, /* REVIEW - Eh, not so sure abt this one */with a heavy indian accent, failing to notice your presence beside her.
</p>

<p>
    You attempt introducing yourself to get her attention but a hand wave from the doctor causes you to pause. He focuses back on the woman and tells her, 
    <span class="maleSpeech">
        “We can talk about that later, Maria, but didn't you notice our special guest? You don't need to be shy, dear.”
    </span>
</p>

<p>
    /* TODO - Maybe tone down on the description lol */ 
    <span class="femaleSpeech1">
        “G-guest?”
    </span> she asks, pulling down her hood and turning to the side, /*She pulls down her hood,*/revealing the delicate beauty of a young woman — just into her twenties — blessed with striking chestnut/* REVIEW - Maybe chestnut/auburn hair? */ hair, accentuated by her sparkling eyes, that harmoniously complements her auburn-brown skin. /*You wonder why she'd ever hide it from the world.*//*You almost wonder why she isn't more confident with it.*/ 
</p>

/* <p>
    <span class="femaleSpeech1">
        “What guest?”
    </span> she asks, as she turns to her side and finally notices you.
</p> */

<p>
    <span class="femaleSpeech1">
        “Eeek!”
    </span> 
    She almost jumps out of her seat, but catches herself /*just*/ in time. 
    <span class="femaleSpeech1">
        “A-ah, it's you… Sorry about that,”
    </span> she apologises, laughing nervously, 
    <span class="femaleSpeech1">
        “I didn't see you there…”
    </span>

                “Don't beat yourself over it, it happens to the best of us,”
            </span> you tell her. 
            Sticking out your hand, you continue, 
            <span class="femaleSpeech">
                “My name's <<PC>>, and I take it you're Maria. Honestly, if not for you face, I'd have mistaken you for my neighbour/*, Miriam*/; you sound exactly like her. I hope that sweet, young mother's doing well.”

            <span class="femaleSpeech">
                “Well, that was quite rude…
            </span> you reply, wearing a frown, 
            <span class="femaleSpeech">
                “But, it wasn't deliberate so no harm done.”
            </span> 
            Sticking out an arm, you continue,
            <span class="femaleSpeech">
                “In any case, my name's <<PC>>, and you're Maria, right? Your voice reminds me of my neighbour, I almost mistook you for her before I saw your face.”
            </span>
        </p>
    <</if>>
    
    /* Just normal continuation of the passage  */
    <p>
        Maria's face flushes/*REVIEW - 🤷‍♀️ Rewrite this*/ a bit and shakes your hand. She glances over at Mr. Fert — who gives a knowing nod — and turns back to face you before replying, 
        <span class="femaleSpeech1">
            “Well, about that… I <i>am</i> her.”
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        You pause and look at her with a baffled expression. 
        <span class="femaleSpeech">
            “/*Come again?*/That can't be true, you two look nothing alike.”
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        She clasps her hands together and fiddles with her fingers. 
        <span class="femaleSpeech1">
            “I mean, that was all thanks to make-up, lots of it, and the fact that you probably never saw anything else about me other than my face; /*I admit */I am <i>pretty</i> reserved.”
        </span>
    </p>

    <p class="femaleSpeech">
        “But, she's expecting, and I even saw her this morning… Unless, you're also—”
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="femaleSpeech1">
            “Pregnant,”
        </span> she finishes, gesturing to her obscured midsection, with a very red face that asks why she said that. 
        With a bit of squinting, you can see her arms resting over an un-obvious bump. She gently presses into the hidden/*REVIEW - Rewrite this */ mass, as if to make sure you know what she means.
    </p>

    <p>      
        <span class="femaleSpeech">
            “So you were pretending to be my neighbour for a few weeks to successfully spy on me while being pregnant?”
        </span> you tell her, before bowing your head. 
        <span class="femaleSpeech">
            “Man, I'm losing my game…”
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        Maria attempts to gently pat your back and says, 
        <span class="femaleSpeech1">
            “There there… It wasn't exactly easy for me at all, since carrying <i>this</i> around was way more troublesome than I thought; in fact, I wouldn't have gone after you if not for dad over here.”
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        You raise your head up. 
        <span class="femaleSpeech">
            “Dad? Wait, do you mean Mr. Fert is your father?”
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="femaleSpeech1">
            “Well, not by biologically, but yeah. I thought he'd have told you by now since you both were expecting me, right?”
        </span> 
        She turns back to Mr. Fert.
        <span class="femaleSpeech1">
            “…I didn't make a mistake, did I?”
        </span> she says, her voice becoming much softer, as if a child admitting their fault.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mr. Fert grins at his daughter and says, 
        <span class="maleSpeech">
            “There's no problem with that, sweetheart. I believe it was more appropriate for you to say it anyway.”
        </span> 
        You manage to hear a barely audible sigh of relief from her.
    </p>

    <p>
        He pulls down a sleeve, exposing his classical-styled watch, and glances at the time. 
        <span class="maleSpeech">
            “Oh. It's already time to show you where you'll be staying for now. Maria, I'm sorry to cut our meeting short but I'll check in with you shortly. <<PC>>, lets get going.”
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="femaleSpeech1">
            “O-okay, I'll wait…”
        </span> Maria replies, idly rubbing her bump as you and Mr. Fert leave the office.
