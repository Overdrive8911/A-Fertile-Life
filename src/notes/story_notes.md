# Stuff

- The world takes place in 2022.
- Expressing and drinking your own milk when due can encourage labor to start.

## PC

- The PC's canon and default name is Peizhu Noshihamite. /* TODO - Fix this awful name */
- Age: almost 26 years old.
- Birth designation is #0662.
- Her first set of parents believed her to be biologically theirs since she was swapped with their still-birth early enough in a hospital. They eventually died in a car accident when she was 14 (visually) and then adopted properly later. /*REVIEW - This needs rewriting */ Her adopted parents were abusive individuals that died with her documents in a fire.
- Genetically Asian. (Although, she represents multiple Asian heritages simultaneously)
- Peizhu formerly worked in a warehouse.
- Peizhu's long time neighbor is a spy that works for Mr. Fert; her name is Maria.

## Fertilo Inc

- The aim of Fertilo Inc is to reduce the risks and trauma associated with pregnancy and birth, as well as providing surrogacy services for those who'd prefer not to carry their children.
- Children can be stored in nutrition tanks where they essentially don't age. Good for people who aren't ready to raise a child without having to give them out for adoption.
- Three Burns Street is the street where Fertilo Inc is situated.
- Fertilo Inc is owned by Dr Fertilo, although he prefers to go by the name Dr Fert.
- Fertilo Inc and its branches are usually situated in decrepit areas in order to reach more people in need (and the fact that poorer people are more desperate :D).
- Most of the staff is female and a great portion of them serve as surrogates.
- The benefits of being a surrogate include free housing, food, extra salary and free access to the facilities but surrogates are not allowed to leave the premises without permission.

## Dr. Fertilo

- Significant other to Cira.
- Birth designation is #0546.
- Full name is Fertilo Guvala.
- Age: 28 years old

## Cira

- Significant other to Dr. Fert.
- Birth designation is #0454.
- Full name is Cira Guvala.
- Age: 30 years old

## Solomon

## Maria

## Katie

- Receptionist and Nurse in Fertilo Inc.

## Story

- Peizhu, Cira and Fert are some of the more successful results of illegal genetic engineering. Their creation was focused on reproduction and general perfection. They were made to be the progenitors of a super human army. The name of the project was S.H.E.M.P (Super Human Extensive Modification Project).
- S.H.E.M.P fell apart when it was discovered by the government in the 90s. In an attempt to prevent their progress from being seized, they tried to destroy all sources of their work. That included their living experiments like Peizhu, Cira and Fert. Fortunately, S.H.E.M.P was unsuccessful at this due to a double agent named Solomon sabotaging their plans.
- Peizhu was sent to a foster home are tests said she was normal. Cira and Fert escaped and made new identities.
- Over two decades after S.H.E.M.P fell apart, a couple of AWOL government agents discovered some unscathed records and began a mission to continue the original purpose, as well as improving it.
- The accident that happened to Peizhu at her workplace was caused by a sabotage from rogue S.H.E.M.P agents. They made a vat of specially-made chemicals fall onto her. The fact that she survived and started generating pheromones confirmed their suspicions.

## S.H.E.M.P experiments

- Living experiments like Peizhu, Fert, and Cira will be like regular normal human beings until their dormant genetic modifications are triggered. For Peizhu, the accident did it while the latter's activated early in life once they made physical contact.
- Some activating conditions: HRT drugs, concentrated puberty hormones, extensive contact with the opposite sex as long as both members are experiments, birth, etc.
- Experiments are much more efficient and superior mentally, metabolically, physically, etc. The disadvantage is that they can become narcissistic very easily and become severely ill if they don't fulfil their physiological needs like seggs. Anyone with the blueprints of their creation can 'shut them down' if they tap the appropriate areas of the experiments' body.
