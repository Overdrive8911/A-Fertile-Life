# Locations

The name of the town is **Hirtheford** (Samples: Pacochashire, Kendale Lakes, West Enoch, Lake Mylesfort, Joplin, Rockford, Hirtheview) and it's split into 5 regions; North, East, South, West, and Central Hirtheford. Each region is secured by a well-defined electrified wall, as such, the only way through any of then is via the heavily guarded gates with the use of a general permit. The latter can be reasonably obtained by most legal residents without a crime history.

## North Hirtheford

Otherwise called the **Northern District**, in it resides the upper class (or anyone who can scrape enough cash to live there fro more than a month). While most commodities and services seem to be overpriced there, the quality is undeniable and residents have access to some of the best health care and living conditions in the entire city (as long as you can pay for it). Other district locals say that in here, *there will be no want*. As result, the population here is relatively low in comparison with the other districts.

A special permit is required to live here and needed in most transactions. Unfortunately, the chances obtaining this permit are somewhat low without connections to influential people. Failure to show the permit when needed can and will result in fines and/or deportation.

Because of this, it isn't uncommon to find refugee camps around the edges and relatively cheaper parts of the city where crime rates are higher. Rumour has it that the reason all of them haven't been kicked out is because the government uses them as test subjects.

Blue collar jobs are the most common here as well as other high paying occupations including but not limited to science, engineering, medicine, aviation and unfortunately abstract artistry.

## East Hirtheford

Also known as the **Eastern District**, it serves as the home to Hirtheford's marine and foreign exchange industry. Spanning across the right side of the city, several warehouses and ports are stationed, constantly moving goods to and fro the city. Many fishing sites have been built up north as serve as the major source of income, if not as a source of pride, for a lot of its inhabitants.

Recently however, more warehouses and ports have been built and are encroaching on the fishing space for the locals. This has led to a larger outflow of youth looking for work. As result, its population is relatively low and mostly aged.

## South Hirtheford

As the **Southern District**, albeit somewhat smaller than the other districts, it is popularly known for housing the city's waste dump. However, it has served as a place of refugee for those desperate enough and have lost everything else. Many of its residents came from the other districts as a way to escape their crimes or unsustainable livelihoods.

The stench of poverty, faeces, and despair linger on every street. As a way to survive, some of its inhabitants formed gangs over certain regions of the district; as they call it, their territories. Soon enough the district became a crime hotspot and most people in the other districts treat going there as suicide.

However, the entire area isn't a complete waste. Valuable minerals and resources exist in mines constructed before the district was overrun or even designated as a dump altogether, although this information is only available to few.

Rumours as to why the government haven't cleaned out the scum grew after a while. Some say that it's not worth it monetarily, others say the government doesn't have enough resources to go against them, while a few believe that the government use the inhabitants of the district as test subjects. All simply rumours, of course.

## West Hirtheford

The largest region in Hirtheford, the **Western District**, contains the majority of the city's population. Complete with decent apartments, recreational zones, medical, educational, and occupational facilities, as well as, satisfactory distribution of essential amenities, the district provides proper care to its residents. *Or at least it did*

In the past, it served well as a place for people to live, but due to recent harshening conditions in the other regions, refugees flocking in have caused problems related to over-congestion and proper resource allocation.

At the moment, it is still suitable for a relatively normal life since the inflow of immigrants has been drastically slowed due to the law enforcers.

## Central Hirtheford

**The Central District** is the heart of the economy; the headquarters of many operations are based here. Numerous skyscrapers pierce the sky, housing the nerve centers of the city's commerce. Swarms of businesspeople busy the streets, moving along to their work places.

Tons of shops and stalls can be found advertising and bargaining their wares to tired workers, protected by the especially large walls of the district.

For some reason, a considerable amount of factories are situated closer to the south. TODO
